    "* Robot Operating System\n",
    "* Something between a middleware and a framework build for robotic applications\n",
    "* ROS goals:\n",
    "  * Provide a standard for robotic applications\n",
    "  * Use on any robot\n",
    "* When to use ROS:\n",
    "  * When you have complicated configurations of sensors, actuators and controllers and adding any code for a new sensor is difficult\n",
    "  * ROS2 helps whenever you need software that requires a lot of communcation between its subprograms\n",
    "* What is ROS2?\n",
    "  * Provides code separation and a set of communication tools to easily communication between all your subprograms\n",
    "  * Example: \n",
    "    * You have Nodes in ROS which are individual blocks of code that can be camera software, navigation algorithm and etc (like the backend software). \n",
    "    * These are independent blocks/Nodes and ROS2 allows communication between each other in away that is powerful and scalable\n",
    "  * ROS2 provides tools and libraries which save time such as Navigation Library for path planning\n",
    "  * ROS is language agnostic i.e. each Node can be any language (Python, C++)\n",

    "ROS 2 relies on the notion of combining workspaces using the shell environment. “Workspace” is a ROS term for the location on your system where you’re developing with ROS 2. The core ROS 2 workspace is called the **underlay**. Subsequent local workspaces are called **overlays**. When developing with ROS 2, you will typically have several workspaces active concurrently.\n",
